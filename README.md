## Overview

Amidst the rise of depression during these challenging times, people are actively seeking a singular solution - that one medication or drug capable of combatting this ailment. Enter Psilocybin Mushrooms, colloquially known as Magic Mushrooms or Psychedelic Mushrooms. These mushrooms, however, are no ordinary fungi; they harbor a key component called Psilocybin. But what exactly is Psilocybin? Psilocybin, categorized as a classic hallucinogen, is a chemical produced by over 100 mushroom species worldwide. Its influence extends to various serotonin receptors, particularly 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C, situated across different brain regions including the cerebral cortex and thalamus (Daniel and Haberman, 2018). In recent times, a noticeable trend has emerged - a burgeoning interest in exploiting Psilocybin as a potential remedy for depression. This shift has steered individuals towards unconventional forms of medicine in pursuit of a depression solution. 

This project aims unveil potential links between depression among users of psychedelic substances and the co-occurrence of other ailments through exploratory data analysis.
