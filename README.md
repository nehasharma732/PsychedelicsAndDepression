## Overview

The intriguing realm of Psilocybin Mushrooms, commonly known as Psychedelic Mushrooms, has captivated the interest of popculture and academics alike. These unique fungi contain Psilocybin, a psychedelic compound categorized as a classic hallucinogen. Its influence extends to various serotonin receptors across different brain regions including the cerebral cortex and thalamus (Daniel and Haberman, 2018), and throughout the body. 

In recent times, a noticeable trend has emerged - a growing curiosity about the potential therapeutic applications of non- conventional drugs, particularly in the context of depression and other medical conditions. This shift has led individuals to explore the possibility of using Psilocybin as a potential remedy for their health issues.

This project aims unveil potential links between depression among users of psychedelic substances and the co-occurrence of other ailments through exploratory data analysis.
